        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>During a gap year in 2022/3, I founded the <a href="https://betterplanning.ie/" target="_blank">Better Planning Alliance</a> to research the potential of supply-side housing policies in Ireland.  I modelled a number of proposed policies, including <a href="https://betterplanning.ie/street-plans/" target="_blank">Street Plans</a> and <a href="https://betterplanning.ie/adus-for-ireland/" target="_blank">Accessory Dwelling Units</a>, that could help
            ease Ireland's housing shortage. This was inspired by the <a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-housing-theory-of-everything/" target="_blank">Housing Theory of Everything</a> which states the developed world's ailments are easily treated
            by solving housing shortages, an idea due to John Myers, Sam Bowman and Ben Southwood. Reforming planning in Ireland has the potential to turn development from a zero-sum to a positive-sum game. Along the way I met so many interesting people and I acquired a co-founder
            <a href="https://twitter.com/o_mcpartlin" target="_blank">Seán O'Neill McPartlin</a>, who now leads the BPA.</a></li>


            <p> The project led to my being quoted in <a href="https://www.economist.com/international/2023/09/06/the-growing-global-movement-to-restrain-house-prices" target="_blank">The Economist</a> on Irish housing policy and some coverage in the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/2023/09/14/street-plans-could-deliver-14000-new-homes-annually-and-help-solve-housing-crisis/" target="_blank">Irish Times</a> as well as <a href="https://thecurrency.news/articles/125922/a-new-route-through-planning-that-could-lead-to-up-to-447000-additional-homes/" target="_blank">The Currency</a>. <p>

            <p> Researching such policies from a farm in the West of Ireland involved extensive use of Google Earth, Google Maps and spreadsheets in addition to giving me exposure to civic hacking, fundraising and alliance building. I was fortunate to receive extensive mentorship from <a href="https://x.com/johnrmyers?lang=en" target="_blank">John Myers</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/freddie_poser" target="_blank">Freddie Poser</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/bswud" target="_blank">Ben Southwood</a>,<a href="https://twitter.com/s8mb" target="_blank">Sam Bowman</a> and <a href="https://x.com/_arnauds_" target="_blank">Arnaud Schenk</a>. I am grateful for the support from <a href="https://twitter.com/tylercowen" target="_blank">Tyler Cowen</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ns_whit" target="_blank">Nick Whitaker</a> and <a href="https://x.com/_tamarawinter" target="_blank">Tamara Winter</a>.

            <p>Funding was received from the Mercatus Center through their <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/emergent-ventures" target="_blank">Emergent Ventures</a> programme and <a href="https://www.joinef.com/" target="_blank">Entrepreneur First</a> through their <a href="https://www.polaris-fellowship.com/" target="_blank">Polaris Fellowship</a>. <p>
